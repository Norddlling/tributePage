          <li><strong>1940</strong> - Ernst Boris Chain and Edward Abraham published its first results in studying the molecular structure of the antibiotic</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - The Oxford team produced the pure penicillin compound as yellow powder.</li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - Fleming was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)</li>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em>In 1999, Time magazine named Fleming one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, stating:</em></p>
          <em>It was a discovery that would change the course of history. The active ingredient in that mould, which Fleming named penicillin, turned out to be an infection-fighting agent of enormous potency. When it was finally recognized for what it was, the most efficacious life-saving drug in the world, penicillin would alter forever the treatment of bacterial infections. By the middle of the century, Fleming's discovery had spawned a huge pharmaceutical industry, churning out synthetic penicillins that would conquer some of mankind's most ancient scourges, including syphilis, gangrene and tuberculosis.</em>
